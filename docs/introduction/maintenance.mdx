# Documentation Maintenance

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). In addition, [Bun](https://bun.sh) is used for package management and runtime. Thus, it is required that you have Bun installed in order to continue.

## Setup

### Step 1 - Clone the documentation repository

Clone this repository directly using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCMercedACM/chapter-docs
```

### Step 2 - Install dependencies and tooling

:::warning

[Bun](https://bun.sh) **must** be installed for this step and others

:::

Within the freshly cloned repository, install the tooling and dependencies that is required

```bash
bun install
```

### Step 3 - Run the development server

By using `bun start`, we can start the development server, which will be helpful to write, and view changes

```bash
bun start
```

## Details

### MDX for Markdown

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) allows us to integrate JSX components directly to our Markdown content. All documentation content are in MDX to allow for this to take advantage. Further details of how Docusaurus uses MDX can be found within [Docsuarus's documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react). All markdown content found within the `docs` folder must have the file extension `*.mdx`.

### Structure

```text
docs/
├── introduction/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── ...
└── projects/
    ├── chapter-website/
    │   ├── _category_.json
    │   └── ...
    ├── kanae/
    │   ├── _category_.json
    │   └── ...
    └── index.mdx
```

Note that `...` stands for other Markdown content, just to make it more simpler. New sections, must be a folder within the `docs` folder. I.e., if an request to include a new section, such as `Administrative`, then the name of the folder must be of the section in all lowercase. If an subsection needs to be included, please make another folder of the same name of the proposed subsection in lowercase, and include the category metadata through [`_category_.json`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#category-item-metadata). All folders need an file present, which is the index file for each section. The file is the index, i.e. `index.mdx`.

### Code Formatting

Generally, Markdown content does not need to be linted or formatter, although it is recommended to have the [markdownlint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) installed to find common Markdown errors and others.

For all other logic, which includes the TSX code that is used to build the front page and custom cards, [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) is used instead. [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) is used as an Git hooks manager. Lefthook is automatically included and ran during post-installation of installing dependencies.
