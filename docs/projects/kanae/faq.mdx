# FAQ

This document serves to answer some common questions about the project.

## How do I get started?

1. It is recommended to read over the [Introduction](./index.mdx#introduction) document. This goes over the basics of the project,
and the subsections of this documentation also go in-depth about it.

2. Ask the webmaster for a Basecamp invite. This is what is primarily used to triage and work on the project as a team.

3. If you have any questions, put them down either in the respective Basecamp projects, or in the `ucmacm-website` channel.

## How do I contribute?

Please read the [contributing](https://github.com/UCMercedACM/kanae/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.
This document goes over the basics of how to contribute
and the suggested guidelines to follow.

## I can't get the database to connect with Kanae

This is most likely due to an incorrect URI connection string being provided.
A different quirk with the PostgreSQL docker images is that the `user` by default, which that user is the root `postgres` user.
In short, this means that you would need to adjust your connection URI to the one below. Make sure to change out the password for a password of your own.

```bash
postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/kanae
```

:::warning

You need to make sure that the password that is set in the environment variable `DB_PASSWORD` (found inside `docker/.env`) is the exact same one specified
within your connection URI string.

For example:

The environment variable (within `docker/.env`):

```bash
DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
```

Within `server/config.yml`

```yaml
postgres_uri: "postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/kanae"
```
