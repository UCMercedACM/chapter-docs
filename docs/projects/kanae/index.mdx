# Introduction

The backend uses to be split between five microservices 4 years ago, all written in different programming languages.
2 years ago, it was migrated to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). After the issues that plagued last year's development
and the ACM Google account being 2FA-locked, it was decided to just make the backend from the ground up. Thus, this is what
Kanae is - an monolithic server application designed to centralize the features of the old microservice, and to build it on
a platform that was easily extensible, and taught frequently.

Under the hood, Kanae is built on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), which makes it much faster to develop. Internally as well,
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for data storage, and [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is used as a global cache for the rate limiter, and sometimes caching content.

## Prerequisites

There are some tools that you would need to have installed before you continue. They are listed below:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
- [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/)

:::important

It's also important to read the [contributing](https://github.com/UCMercedACM/kanae/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, as they are recommendations on how you should contribute.

:::

## Setup

Kanae only supports Python 3.9 or higher

:::note

You need to ensure that PostgreSQL and Redis are up before setting up Kanae. Please see the [Database](#database) section for further instruction.
:::

### Step 1 - Clone the repo

In order to work on the project at all, we need to clone the repo down.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCMercedACM/kanae
```

### Step 2 - Create a virtualenv

Creating an virtualenv allows our dependencies to not mix with global dependencies.
For more information, please see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41972262) Stackoverflow post.

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

### Step 3 - Activate the virtualenv

Next, we are going to activate the virtualenv so we can install our dependencies into it.

```bash
# Linux/MacOS
$ source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
$ venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

### Step 4 - Install dependencies

We are just going to use good old `pip` to install.
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) also is supported but please see the instructions on their documentation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt \
&& lefthook install
```

### Step 5 - Copying configuration templates

The server is configured by using a YAML configuration, which a template of it is included in the repo.
We need to copy it over and modify the values as needed.

```bash
cp config.dist.yml server/config.yml
```

### Step 6 - Run the SQL migrations

Kanae uses [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) to manage schema migrations. Specifically, [Declarative Migrations](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#declarative-migrations)
are used instead. This type of migration is very similar to how Git works. To simplify things, use the task command below instead. Continue to finish the prompts.

```bash
task schema-apply
```

### Step 7 - Running the development server

Unlike what FastAPI tells you, Kanae by default includes a launcher of its own. We need to run it with no Uvicorn workers
so development goes easier. The follow command executes this.

```bash
uvicorn launcher:app --app-dir=server --reload-exclude=venv --reload
```

Alternatively, ``task start`` can be used as a shortcut if you have Task installed.

Once done, navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000` and verify that it works.

## Database

The database used are PostgreSQL and Redis. By default, a Docker Compose file is included for spinning up these for development.
Setup instructions are as follows:

### Step 1 - Copy `.env` template

Copy `docker/example.env` to `.env` within the `docker` folder. Modify as appropriate.

```bash
cp docker/example.env docker/.env
```

### Step 2 - Run the servers

All you need to do is to run the following command.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Details

### Typing Hinting

Kanae actively uses [type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in order to verify for types before runtime.
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is used to enforce this standard. Checks happen before you commit, and on Github actions.
This also can be activated in VSCode, and Pyright is available as a LSP on Neovim.

### Prometheus

Kanae also comes bundled with an Prometheus exporter for metrics collections. By default, it is not enabled, you can enable it with the `kanae.prometheus.enabled` key. By default, no efforts are made for whether the endpoint is exposed publicly, as this is the responsibility of the web server (i.e, NGINX and co.), not the application. The endpoint is exposed under the `/metrics` path of the application.
