# Introduction

The backend uses to be split between five microservices 4 years ago, all written in different programming languages.
2 years ago, it was migrated to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). After the issues that plagued last year's development
and the ACM Google account being 2FA-locked, it was decided to just make the backend from the ground up. Thus, this is what
Kanae is - an monolithic server application designed to centralize the features of the old microservice, and to build it on
a platform that was easily extensible, and taught frequently.

Under the hood, Kanae is built on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), which makes it much faster to develop. Internally as well,
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for data storage, and [Redis](https://redis.io) is used as a global cache for
ratelimits, and sometimes caching content.

## Prerequisites

There are some tools that you would need to have installed before you continue. They are listed below:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
- [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/)

:::important

It's also important to read the [contributing](../contributing) guidelines, as they are recommendations on how you should contribute.

## Setup

Kanae only supports Python 3.9 or higher

:::note

You need to ensure that PostgreSQL and Redis are up before setting up Kanae. Please see the [Database](#database) section for further instruction.
:::

### Step 1 - Clone the repo

In order to work on the project at all, we need to clone the repo down.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCMercedACM/kanae
```

### Step 2 - Create a virtualenv

Creating an virtualenv allows our dependencies to not mix with global dependencies.
For more information, please see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41972262) Stackoverflow post.

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

### Step 3 - Activate the virtualenv

Next, we are going to activate the virtualenv so we can install our dependencies into it.

```bash
# Linux/MacOS
$ source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
$ venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

### Step 4 - Install dependencies

We are just going to use good old `pip` to install.
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) also is supported but please see the instructions on their documentation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt \
&& lefthook install
```

### Step 5 - Copying configuration templates

The server is configured by using a YAML configuration, which a template of it is included in the repo.
We need to copy it over and modify the values as needed.

```bash
cp config.dist.yml server/config.yml
```

### Step 6 - Run the SQL migrations

Kanae uses [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) to manage schema migrations. Specifically, [Declarative Migrations](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#declarative-migrations)
are used instead. This type of migration is very similar to how Git works. To simplify things, use the task command below instead. Continue to finish the prompts.

```bash
task schema-apply
```

### Step 7 - Running the development server

Unlike what FastAPI tells you, Kanae by default includes a launcher of its own. We need to run it with no Uvicorn workers
so development goes easier. The follow command executes this.

```bash
uvicorn launcher:app --app-dir=server --reload-exclude=venv --reload
```

Alternatively, ``task start`` can be used as a shortcut if you have Task installed.

Once done, navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000` and verify that it works.

## Database

The database used are PostgreSQL and Redis. By default, a Docker Compose file is included for spinning up these for development.
Setup instructions are as follows:

### Step 1 - Copy `.env` template

Copy `docker/example.env` to `.env` within the `docker` folder. Modify as appropriate.

```bash
cp docker/example.env docker/.env
```

### Step 2 - Run the servers

All you need to do is to run the following command.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Details

### Typing Hinting

Kanae actively uses [type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in order to verify for types before runtime.
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is used to enforce this standard. Checks happen before you commit, and on Github actions.
This also can be activated in VSCode, and Pyright is available as a LSP on Neovim.
