# Introduction

In a website, the frontend refers to what the user interactive with and sees. Our case is no different then that definition.
[React](https://react.dev), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) is what the frontend primarily uses.

## Prerequisites

There are some tools that you would need to have installed before you continue. They are listed below:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

:::tip

[Volta](https://volta.sh/) is recommended to be used for this project as it makes installing Node.js and configuring it much easier.

It's also important to read the [contributing](../contributing) guidelines, as they are recommendations on how you should contribute.

## Setup

**Node.js v22 or higher is required!**

### Step 1 - Clone the repo

We first need to clone the repo so we can start programming. This can be done shown below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website \
&& cd Chapter-Website/react
```

### Step 2 - Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

:::note

[Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) is automatically installed and set up during this setup.
Each time before you commit, [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) will automatically run to lint and format the code.

### Step 3 - Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Website Structure

Generally, the website is structured into these four main components:

### Homepage

This page serves as the main landing page, and is what is loaded in when someone goes to the website.
Ideally this would contain the necessary information as designed on the wireframe to get the attention of the user.

### Events and Workshops

Although [CatLife](https://ucmerced.presence.io/) does exist, this component itself would allow for much more
detailed information, along with a way to keep track of different events in a convenient and centralized manner.
These are pulled from the backend, which would allow for dynamic content served to the user.

### SIGs Overview

Some people may get confused when first joining the club, so we need a page to display each SIG and what they do.
There are some data that has to be fetched from the backend, but this mostly serves as an informational page.

### Dashboard

We all know that clubs have to make a QR code that goes to a Google Forms link just to get you to sign in to the meeting.
Now with this system, you literally don't have to. Just with a click of a button, you can sign up to attend a workshop
or any important meetings. Also with the added features of reminders via Outlook events, etc.
