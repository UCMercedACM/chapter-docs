## I can't get the database to connect with Kanae!

This is most likely due to an incorrect URI connection string being provided.
A different quirk with the PostgreSQL docker images is that the `user` by default, which that user is the root `postgres` user.
In short, this means that you would need to adjust your connection URI to the one below. Make sure to change out the password for a password of your own.

```bash
postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/kanae
```

:::warning

You need to make sure that the password that is set in the environment variable `DB_PASSWORD` (found inside `docker/.env`) is the exact same one specified
within your connection URI string.

For example:

The environment variable (within `docker/.env`):

```bash
DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
```

Within `server/config.yml`

```yaml
postgres_uri: "postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/kanae"
```
