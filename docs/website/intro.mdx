# Introduction

This is the introduction for the ACM @ UC Merced Website. The website serves as a information hub for members
of the ACM chapter here at UC Merced. Essentially, this website fulfills these tasks:

- Displaying events and workshops
- Information surrounding the different SIGs
- Cataloging current and archived projects
- Internal member management
- Member dashboard

## Components

In order to simplify the technologies used, this project is spilt into three sub-teams. These subteams are the frontend, design, and backend teams.
This documentation primarily aims to be a technical documentation for the frontend and backend teams. Although not made for the design team, some information
in regards to onboarding documentation may be still present.

## Next Steps

If you are here for either teams, look into the guides shown below:

- [Frontend](./frontend/)
- [Backend](./backend/)
